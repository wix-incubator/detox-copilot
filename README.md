# Wix Pilot

A flexible plugin that drives your tests with human-written commands, enhanced by the power of large language models (LLMs).
While originally designed for Detox, Wix Pilot can be extended to **any other testing frameworks**.

It provides clear APIs to perform actions and assertions within your tests while interfacing with an LLM service to enhance the testing process.

## Quick Demo

Here's an example of how Pilot runs over a Detox test case:

The test case is written in a human-readable format, and Pilot translates it into Detox actions on the fly.

**Not just Detox!** Pilot can be extended to any other testing frameworks.

## API Overview

High-level overview of the API that Wix Pilot exposes:

```typescript
/**
 * Initializes the Pilot with the given configuration.
 * Must be called before any other Pilot methods.
 * @param config The configuration for the Pilot.
 */
init: (config: Config) => void;

/**
 * Checks if the Pilot has been initialized.
 * @returns True if the Pilot has been initialized, false otherwise.
 */
isInitialized: () => boolean;

/**
 * Start the Pilot instance.
 * @note Must be called before each flow to ensure a clean state (the Pilot uses the operations history as part of
 * its context).
 */
start: () => void;

/**
 * Finalizes the flow and optionally saves temporary cache data to the main cache.
 * If `isCacheDisabled` is true, the temporary cache will not be saved. False is the default value.
 * @param isCacheDisabled
 * @note This must be called after the flow is complete.
 */
end: (isCacheDisabled?: boolean) => void;

/**
 * Performs a testing operation or series of testing operations in the app based on the given `steps`.
 * @returns The result of the operation(s), which can be a single value or an array of values for each step.
 * @example Tap on the login button
 * @example Scroll down to the 7th item in the Events list
 * @example The welcome message should be visible
 * @example The welcome message text should be "Hello, world!"
 * @example [
 *    'Tap on the login button',
 *    'A login form should be visible',
 * ]
 */
perform: (steps: string | string[]) => Promise<any | any[]>;
```

### Additional Note

In addition to the operations history, Pilot maintains a repository-level cache. If you need to ignore the current cache for any reason (e.g., when adding an action to the testing framework driver), you can set the environment variable `PILOT_OVERRIDE_CACHE` to "true" before running your tests. This will ensure that the current cache is not taken into consideration and will override the existing one.

```shell
export PILOT_OVERRIDE_CACHE=true
```

If you want to disable the override after setting it to "true" and revert to using the cache, you can set `PILOT_OVERRIDE_CACHE` to "false"

```shell
export PILOT_OVERRIDE_CACHE=false
```


## Integration with Testing Frameworks

Wix Pilot requires two main components to work:

### **Prompt Handler**

An adapter that interfaces with the LLM service to generate actions based on the provided prompts. For example, GPT, Gemini, Sonnet or any other LLM service.

#### `PromptHandler` Interface

```typescript
/**
 * Sends a prompt to the AI service and returns the response.
 * @param prompt The prompt to send to the AI service.
 * @param image Optional path to the image to upload to the AI service that captures the current UI state.
 * @returns The response from the AI service.
 */
runPrompt: (prompt: string, image?: string) => Promise<string>;

/**
 * Checks if the AI service supports snapshot images for context.
 */
isSnapshotImageSupported: () => boolean;
```

### Testing Framework Driver

An adapter that interfaces with the testing framework to execute the generated actions. For example, Detox, Appium, Espresso, XCTest or any other testing framework.

In order for Pilot to work with the testing framework, the driver provides the API catalog and the JS context to execute the generated actions.

#### `TestingFrameworkDriver` Interface

```typescript
/**
 * Takes a snapshot of the current screen and returns the path to the saved image.
 * If the driver does not support image, return undefined.
 */
captureSnapshotImage: () => Promise<string | undefined>;

/**
 * Returns the current view hierarchy in a string representation.
 */
captureViewHierarchyString: () => Promise<string>;

/**
 * The available API methods of the testing framework.
 */
apiCatalog: TestingFrameworkAPICatalog;
```
