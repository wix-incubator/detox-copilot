# Contributing to Pilot

We welcome contributions to **Pilot**, whether through ideas, bug reports, code enhancements, or prompt handlers. Below, you'll find the main ways to contribute and collaborate with our community.

For reference on integrating with frameworks, see the [Implementing Custom Testing Framework Driver Guide](./implementing-custom-testing-framework-driver.md).

## Types of Contributions

### 1. **Report Issues**

Help us improve by reporting:
- Bugs you encounter.
- Ideas for new features or enhancements.

Submit your issues through our [GitHub Issues Page](https://github.com/wix-incubator/pilot/issues). Providing detailed information about the problem or idea will help us address it more effectively.

### 2. **Code Contributions**

We're always open to bug fixes and improvements. Whether it's refining existing functionality or adding new features, your code contributions are invaluable.

**High-level contribution steps:**
- Propose your idea or fix via a GitHub issue.
- Collaborate with maintainers to align on the approach.
- Submit your pull request with well-documented changes.

### 3. **Prompt Handlers for the Community**

Extend Pilot's capabilities by creating prompt handlers for popular services like OpenAI and Claude. These handlers enable Pilot to interpret and execute natural language commands more effectively.

- Design and implement handlers for specific use cases.
- Share examples and best practices to help other developers.

### 4. **Framework Integrations**

Expand Pilot's reach by integrating it with new testing frameworks. This involves developing the necessary drivers and APIs to enable Pilot's compatibility with the framework.

Check how to implement a custom testing framework driver in the [Implementing Custom Testing Framework Driver Guide](./implementing-custom-testing-framework-driver.md).
