# Technical Overview

Wix Pilot integrates seamlessly with your testing environment by combining natural language processing with robust testing capabilities.

## Building Blocks of Wix Pilot

To enable Wix Pilot to work harmoniously with your testing framework and app, it relies on several building blocks:

- **Dynamic Code Generation**: Pilot generates testing code on-the-fly to perform actions or assertions based on your instructions.
- **Visual Analysis**: Pilot can analyze the app's screen to verify the presence of specific elements or text, enabling assertions beyond standard UI checks.
- **App View Hierarchy**: The testing framework generates an XML representation of the app's view hierarchy, helping Pilot interact with all UI elements, even those not directly visible.
- **Snapshot Images**: Optional snapshot images provide Pilot with visual context for more precise understanding and analysis.
- **API Catalog**: Pilot uses an extensible API catalog that can be enriched with custom testing commands and context.
- **Caching Mechanism**: Pilot caches execution results to optimize performance and reduce unnecessary LLM calls.
- **Test Context Awareness**: Pilot maintains awareness of previously executed steps, ensuring continuity and readability in the test flow.

## Pilot's Execution Flow

The execution flow of Wix Pilot can be broken down into these main steps:

1. **Initialize**: Set up Pilot with your framework configuration using `Pilot.init()`.
2. **Start Session**: Begin a test flow with `pilot.start()`.
3. **Execute Tests**: Choose between:
   - Single steps using `pilot.perform()` for granular control
   - Automated flows using `pilot.autopilot()` for goal-driven testing
4. **End Session**: Conclude the test flow with `pilot.end()`.

### Performance Optimization

Pilot implements several optimization strategies:
- **Smart Caching**: Temporary and permanent caching of execution results
- **Configurable Analysis Modes**: Control the depth of visual analysis
- **Extensible API Catalog**: Add custom commands to reduce LLM calls
- **Snapshot Management**: Efficient handling of screen captures and comparisons

You can configure these optimizations through the `Config` options when initializing Pilot:
```typescript
pilot.init({
  frameworkDriver: yourDriver,
  promptHandler: yourHandler,
  options: {
    cacheMode: 'full' | 'lightweight' | 'disabled',
    analysisMode: 'basic' | 'detailed'
  }
});
```
